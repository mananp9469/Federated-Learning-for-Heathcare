# Federated-Learning-for-Heathcare

• Designed a federated learning system in healthcare among wearable devices and a central server to predict heart strokes using ANNs. Employed FedAVG and FedAdagrad, to aggregate optimizer weights received from multiple WDs.


• Incorporated Ascon-128a encryption to ensure data privacy while transferring optimizer weights. Achieved remarkable accuracy improvements (10%-15% higher) over traditional approaches, ideal for real-time application on wearable devices. Key performance metrics include precision, recall, and F1-score.
